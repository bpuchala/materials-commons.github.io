Package materials_commons
=========================

The package **materials_commons** consists of three parts: the Python AIP, **materials_commons.api**,
the Command Line Interface, **materials_commons.cli**, and a newly developend set of scripts for
Extraction Transformation and Loading (ETL) of experiment workflows from well formatted Excel
spreadsheets, **materials_commons.etl**. The ETL part is in pre-alpha development, subject to
frequent change and (therefore) excluded from this documentation. Contact the developers and/or
review the code at the GitHub site, if you are interested in details.

This package relates to the original Materials Commons service running at MaterialsCommons.org,
that is https://materialscommons.org. The server code is available on
GitHub at https://github.com/materials-commons/materialscommons.org.
Full documentation is also available: https://materials-commons.github.io/ .
