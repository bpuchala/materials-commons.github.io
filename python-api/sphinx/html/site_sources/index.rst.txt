Package materials_commons
=========================

The package **materials_commons** consists of three parts. The Python AIP, **materials_commons.api**,
the Command Line Interface, **materials_commons.cli**, and a newly developend set of scripts for
Extraction Transformation and Loading (ETL) of experiment workflows from well formatted Excel
spreadsheets, **materials_commons.etl**. The ETL segment, **materials_commons.etl**, is in pre-alpha
development and (therefore) excluded from this documentation. Contact the developers if you are interested
in details.
